                <p>
                I am orginally from Baton Rouge la, but currently reside in Houston Tx. and have for the past 13 years.
          My education is in graphic design and having graduated from the Art Institue of Houston in 1992, I decided to put
          that on hold and joined the millitary spending the next 4 years in the Navy.
          After receiving an honorable discharge in 1998 I moved to Monroe La where my family currently live, I got in to 
          videography and video editing for a local Fox News station and have been doing some form of video production and 
          graphic design ever since. 
          I am currently trying to acheive new goals by gaining a new skill set in computer programing.
